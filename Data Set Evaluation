Using information from a data set containing USA population data I will create a graph showing the population change in the USA from 1970 to 2023. I can also use this data set to look at the changes in births and deaths over time. I obtained these data through Texas A&M University: https://trerc.tamu.edu/data/population/?data-Country=United+States. This dataset can be evaluated using the FAIR principles: Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. The dataset is findable because it comes from the US Census Bureau Population Estimates Program where you can search for specific datasets. It does have some metadata that describes the data well and gives information on what is in the dataset. The dataset is accessible because it is open to anyone to download it. It does not contain any sensitive information that could be used to identify someone. The dataset is in a .csv format so it does have interoperability. I think it is reusable since there is good documentation about where the data comes from and it does get updated by the US Census Bureau.
